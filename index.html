            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have two main hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tennis:</strong> Tennis is not just a sport for me; it's a way of life. I love the excitement of the game, the strategy involved, and the thrill of competition. I've played tennis since I was 3 years old, took competitive plasses from the age of 13, and have played tournaments since the age of 15, however, due to succesive injuries, I am painfully forced to follow tennis from my chair, as I work to get myself back in shape. My favorite player is Novak Djokovic for his perseverence, mentality, and overall physicall prowess.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Formula One:</strong> Formula One racing is another passion. The speed, precision, and technological advancements in this sport fascinate me. I follow every race sunday, and suppost VCARB, Visa Cashapp Racing Bulls, formerly Scuderia Alphatauri. My favorite drivers are Daniel Riciardo and Yuki Tsunoda, and my prediction for this season seems to be looking like a dutchman in a rocketship!
                </li>
            </ul>
